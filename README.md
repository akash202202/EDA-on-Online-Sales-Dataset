This project aims to analyze an online sales dataset to uncover insights and patterns that can help improve business decision-making. By performing EDA, we can understand the dataset's structure, detect anomalies, identify trends, and visualize key metrics. Features: Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Descriptive Statistics: Summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset's distribution. Trend Analysis: Identify trends over time, including sales peaks and seasonal variations. Customer Analysis: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Product Analysis: Evaluate product performance based on sales volumes and revenue. Visualizations: Create bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and more to represent the data visually. Technologies Used: Python: Main programming language for scripting and analysis. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis. NumPy: Numerical operations. Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
